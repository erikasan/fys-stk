In this folder we have the notebook and two python files that test the code. We also have some of the main code in this folder because the test is dependent on the code being in the same folder.

* FysStk-project1-mylearn.ipynb contains (needs to be in same folder as mylearn, so we have also a copy of mylearn here):
> * calculation of the MSE
> * plotting of test vs train as function of complexity
> * bias vs variance with bootstrap
> * implementation of k-fold as a function of complexity
> * implementation of the methods on terrain data

* Ridge plotting
* Lasso plotting
