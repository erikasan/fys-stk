# Project 1

All code written by Oda Hovet (odasho), Ilse Kuperus (ilseku) and Erik Alexander Sandvik (erikasan)

## Report Folder
* Contains the PDF file of the report

## Code
* mylearn
> * MSE, R2 methods
> * Fitting and predicting using OLS and Ridge regression
> * kfold

## Test
* FysStk-project1-mylearn.ipynb contains (needs to be in same folder as mylearn, so we have also a copy of mylearn here):
> * calculation of the MSE
> * plotting of test vs train as function of complexity
> * bias vs variance with bootstrap
> * implementation of k-fold as a function of complexity
> * implementation of the methods on terrain data


## Figures
* Result images

## Drafts
* Drafts for the final report and code not used for final results
